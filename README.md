#### This repository was created for the purpose of testing delphix compatibility with github actions automations.

#### It has two workflows:

  - **Create** - Whenever a branch is created, a VDB is automatically generated in Delphix with the same name.

  - **Delete** - Whenever a branch is deleted, a VDB with the same name is automatically deleted in Delphix.
